# CivicFix AI 🌍

### AI-Powered Smart City Grievance & Sustainability Platform

> **Capture. Report. Improve Your City.**

CivicFix AI is a citizen-focused application that helps people document civic problems such as potholes, overflowing garbage, damaged roads, drainage issues, and streetlight failures.

Users can capture or upload an image, select a city and location, receive AI-assisted issue classification, find the relevant municipal reporting channel, and generate a clear complaint for review and submission.

This project is designed as an **AI + Sustainability** initiative aligned primarily with **UN Sustainable Development Goal 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities**.

## 📌 Problem Statement

Citizens regularly notice civic problems such as potholes, unmanaged waste, damaged roads, drainage issues, and broken streetlights. However, many people do not know which municipal department is responsible, where to submit a complaint, or how to describe the issue clearly.

Existing reporting processes can be fragmented and difficult to navigate. As a result, some problems remain unreported, complaints may lack useful information, and citizens may struggle to follow up.

CivicFix AI addresses this gap by combining image-based AI assistance, location selection, authority information, and AI-supported complaint generation in one user-friendly platform.

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution

CivicFix AI provides a structured reporting workflow:

1. Capture or upload a photograph of a civic issue.
2. Analyze the image using an AI classification service.
3. Allow the user to confirm or correct the detected category.
4. Select the city, area, and location.
5. Find the relevant municipal department or official grievance channel.
6. Generate a professional complaint draft using AI.
7. Let the user review and edit the complaint.
8. Open the official email or grievance portal for submission.
9. Save the complaint reference number and track updates where supported.

The system is designed to assist citizens, not to replace official municipal processes.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Make civic issue reporting easier to understand.
- Reduce confusion about municipal reporting channels.
- Help users create clear and structured complaints.
- Use AI for image classification and text generation.
- Support reporting related to sustainable cities and sanitation.
- Keep citizens in control of final submission.
- Encourage transparent and responsible use of AI.

- Provide official grievance portal links.
- Show the source or verification date of authority information.
- Avoid generating or guessing unknown email addresses.

### 5. AI Complaint Generator

The application can prepare:

- Complaint subject
- Issue description
- Location details
- Date and time
- Suggested request for action
- Image attachment guidance

Users can edit the draft before submission.

### 6. Complaint Tracking

- Store submitted complaint details.
- Save a user-entered reference number.
- Display the current status when supported by a connected source.
- Clearly distinguish user-entered information from verified live updates.

### 7. Impact Dashboard

Potential dashboard information includes:

- Number of submitted reports
- Issue categories
- Area-wise issue distribution
- Status breakdown
- Community reporting trends

Only real, consented, and appropriately anonymized data should be used for impact claims.

## 🤖 AI Components

| Component | Purpose |
|---|---|
| Image Classification | Suggest the category of a visible civic issue |
| Multimodal AI | Process image and text inputs where supported |
| Large Language Model | Generate an editable complaint draft |
| Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) | Retrieve official municipal procedures and contact information |
| Agentic Workflow | Coordinate issue analysis, missing details, retrieval, and drafting |
| OCR | Read relevant text from signs or documents when appropriate |

### Important AI Limitation

AI results may be incorrect or incomplete. CivicFix AI should always allow the user to verify the issue category, location, complaint text, and authority before submission.

---

## 🧠 RAG Workflow

The Retrieval-Augmented Generation workflow can be structured as follows:

```text
User selects city and issue category
                |
                v
Retrieve trusted municipal information
                |
                v
Filter by city, area, department, and issue type
                |
                v
Return official procedure and contact source
                |
                v
Generate complaint guidance
                |
                v
User reviews and submits through official channel
```

### Suggested RAG Data Fields

- City
- State
- Area or zone
- Issue category
- Department
- Official email
- Official grievance portal
- Source URL
- Verification date
- Notes or eligibility requirements

The RAG dataset should be populated with verified information. If verified data is unavailable, the application should clearly state that the authority information is unavailable rather than inventing details.

---

## 🔁 Agent Logic

A possible agent workflow:

```text
START
  |
  v
Receive image, location, and user description
  |
  v
Analyze the image
  |
  v
Suggest issue category
  |
  v
Ask user to confirm or correct
  |
  v
Check for missing location or description
  |
  v
Retrieve authority information
  |
  v
Generate editable complaint
  |
  v
User reviews complaint
  |
  v
Open official submission channel
  |
  v
Save reference number if available
  |
  v
END
```

The agent must not independently accuse individuals, determine legal responsibility, or submit a complaint without appropriate user control.
